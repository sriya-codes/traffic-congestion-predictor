# Traffic Congestion Predictor

This project uses machine learning models to predict traffic congestion levels based on historical and real-time data.

# Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- Matplotlib for visualization

# Problem Statement
Traffic congestion is a rising issue in urban cities. This model was built to:
- Predict congestion based on time of day and road usage
- Help optimize routing for ride-sharing and logistics apps

# Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Regression model training and evaluation
- Traffic congestion level prediction
- Basic visualizations of congestion trends

# Accuracy
Achieved prediction error under 10% on test data using Random Forest Regression.

# Future Enhancements
- Integrate Google Maps live API
- Build real-time congestion heatmaps
- Deploy on Streamlit for demo interface
